### Meteora

Meteora is an experiment in note taking.

- A sense of urgency: Notes can be indefinite, periodic or deadlined
- Progress: Notes progress depending on granular completion
- Priority: Each not has a priotity, amplified by urgency
- Tags: they tie notes to intitiatives, outcomes or categories. Abuse them as you like.
